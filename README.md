# 🍔 Mobile Ordering App

### A Seamless Restaurant Ordering Experience! 🛒

---

## 📌 Overview

**Mobile Ordering App** is a **restaurant ordering platform** that allows users to:  
✅ **Browse the menu** and view available meals.  
✅ **Add meals to their cart** 🛒.  
✅ **Remove items from the cart** if needed.  
✅ **Proceed to checkout**, where they enter payment details 💳.  
✅ **Receive an order confirmation** with their name.

This project was built from scratch as part of **Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Course** under the **Solo Project** module. The **main goal** was to refine my **JavaScript skills** by creating a real-world application with dynamic user interactions.
