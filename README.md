# 🍔 Mobile Ordering App

### A Seamless Restaurant Ordering Experience! 🛒

---

## 📌 Overview

**Mobile Ordering App** is a **restaurant ordering platform** that allows users to:  
✅ **Browse the menu** and view available meals.  
✅ **Add meals to their cart** 🛒.  
✅ **Remove items from the cart** if needed.  
✅ **Proceed to checkout**, where they enter payment details 💳.  
✅ **Receive an order confirmation** with their name.

This project was built from scratch as part of **Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Course** under the **Solo Project** module. The **main goal** was to refine my **JavaScript skills** by creating a real-world application with dynamic user interactions.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals** through practical implementation.
- **Work with forms and user input validation**.

## 🔥 Key Concepts Practiced

This project helped reinforce my understanding of the following **JavaScript concepts**:

✅ **.map()** – To display menu items dynamically.

✅ **Object destructuring** – To access and manipulate meal data.  
✅ **Arrow functions** – For cleaner and more readable code.  
✅ **Ternary conditions** – To toggle UI states.  
✅ **Spread operator (`...`)** – To manage cart data.  
✅ **Not operator (`!`)** – To handle conditional logic.  
✅ **Import/export** – To organize the codebase.  
✅ **.splice()** – To remove meals from the cart.  
✅ **.find() & .findIndex()** – To check for meals in the cart.  
✅ **.reduce()** – To calculate the **total cost** of selected meals.  
✅ **Local Storage** – To retain cart data after page refresh.  
✅ **FormData** – To handle payment form inputs.  
✅ **Form validation** – To ensure correct user input before processing orders.
